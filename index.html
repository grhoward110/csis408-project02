                <!-- <h2>How to Use Liberty Suggestion Web Application?</h2>
                
                <p>To use this web application productively, the participate needs to sign up for the web application by creating a username and password. The username needs to be a valid email address and a creative password that involves mix-characters such as: letters, numbers, and special characters. Once the participate has signed up, he or she can login into the website with the same username and password from now on. Whether the participate is signing up for the first time or logging in at various times afterwards, the login or sign up form leads to a different page known as the suggestion box.</p>
                
                <p>The suggestion box is the functionality component of the web application. It allow the participate to communicate with the administrators of the web application. The administrators are part of the staff at Liberty University and this web application helps them know about the participate's on campus problems that need to be solve on a routine basis. Back to the functionality of the web application, in order to create a suggestion request. First, the student or faculty member needs to categorize his or her on campus problem by selecting a category from the drop-down menu. Second, he or she needs to describe the situation of his or her on campus problem by texting or typing out what the current situation is within a 500 character limit. </p>
                
                <p>Finally, the suggestion request and problem can be submitted to the administration. In order to do this, the category of the problem is submitted through the submit button followed by the suggestion request being sent through the send button. If a student or faculty member had a problem creating his or her suggestion request or categorizing the on campus problem then the reset button can reset both the problem and the suggestion request to be rewritten again. After submitting the problem and suggestion request, the participate can view his or her identification, message, category, and approval status (by the administration) of the suggestion request within the submission form of the web application to view all of his or her suggestion requests historically. All suggestion requests within the submission form are viewed from the administration staff and the participate only according to his or her identification. There will be security system modifications in the future to avoid identity theft from within the web application.</p>
